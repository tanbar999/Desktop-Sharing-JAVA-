# Desktop-Sharing-JAVA-
Desktop sharing allows remote access and remote collaboration on a person's computer desktop through a graphical terminal emulator. 

This project has two files REMOTE SERVER SOURCE and REMOTE CLIENT . 
REMOTE SERVER takes the screenshot of the computer on which its running and sends it to the REMOTE CLIENT.
NOTE:BOTH THE COMPUTER SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE SAME WIFI OR ETHERNET HUB.

Using ROBOT class in java , we take the input from the client computer(MOUSE AND KEYBOARD) and send it to the SERVER computer.The CLIENT computer can be ANYWHERE and can control the Server computer remotely.

You can remotely create a file , edit any file , delete any file as well as shutdown any system or look over any kind of file as per the requirement.
